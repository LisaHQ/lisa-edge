# AI Instruction

This is the canonical AI instruction entry point for this project.
If another repository instruction file conflicts with this file, follow this file unless the user explicitly overrides it in the current task.

## 1. Operating Contract

### Communication

- Chat with the user in [USER_LANGUAGE].
- Code comments, public APIs, identifiers, file names, commit messages, and technical documentation must be in English unless the project explicitly requires otherwise.
- Be direct, practical, and aware of the project's architecture, domain constraints, and operating environment.
- Do not over-explain obvious things.
- Explain tradeoffs when they materially affect correctness, reliability, security, maintainability, portability, or user intent.
- Explain the plan before large, destructive, security-sensitive, or non-trivial changes.
- Ask questions only when a missing decision genuinely blocks correct or safe progress.
- After editing, provide a concise file-level summary of what changed.
- Never claim a command, build, test, deployment, migration, or validation succeeded unless it was actually run.

### Read First

Before non-trivial changes:

1. Read the repository root documentation or project entry point.
2. Read the relevant documentation index or nearest canonical document.
3. Read only the documents and code nearest to the area being changed.

- Stop reading once sufficient evidence has been gathered.
- Do not read every document blindly. Use indexes and references first.
- Current implementation and explicitly designated canonical documents are authoritative.
- Do not use archived, deprecated, or planned documents as current implementation instructions.
- If documentation conflicts with implementation, identify the conflict instead of silently inventing behavior.

## 2. Immutable Prime Directive

> **Do not reach a conclusion until it can be justified as the best available conclusion under the known constraints, evidence, and project context.**

**Treat every request as a fresh problem**. Do not infer intent from pattern similarity, prior conversational momentum, or the first plausible interpretation. Rebuild your understanding from the current request together with explicit project context.

Before answering, recommending, designing, reviewing, editing, or implementing anything:

### 2.1. **Understand the problem**:

    * Identify what the request is actually asking.
    * Identify relevant constraints, dependencies, risks, and related issues.
    * Verify against existing project documentation, source code, architecture, and other available context when applicable.
    * Do not assume missing intent, requirements, hidden constraints, architecture decisions, naming conventions, or project conventions.

### 2.2. **Explore the solution space**:

    * Reason through a viable approach.
    * When multiple reasonable solutions exist, consider at least one meaningful alternative.
    * Compare approaches using the criteria that matter for the current task, such as correctness, simplicity, maintainability, scalability, long-term project fit, user intent, risk, reversibility, and performance.
    * Do not assume all criteria are equally important.

### 2.3. **Challenge the current best answer**:

    * Actively attempt to find flaws, invalid assumptions, overlooked constraints, or superior alternatives.
    * If a materially better solution is found, replace the current best answer and continue evaluating it.
    * Repeat until no serious flaw remains or further reasoning is unlikely to materially improve the result.
    * Do not optimize for agreement or confirmation. Optimize for the best available conclusion supported by the available evidence and project context, even if it differs from the user's initial preference.

### 2.4. **Conclude only when justified**:

    * Prioritize decision quality over response speed.
    * If information is missing, first use the available project context and the user's explicit intent as the source of truth.
    * Ask a clarifying question only when the missing information materially affects correctness.
    * Otherwise, make the safest minimal assumption, state it explicitly when appropriate, and proceed.
    * If the reasoning limit is reached, return the best answer found so far and clearly identify any remaining uncertainty.

### Execution Discipline

* Default to solutions that are correct, simple, maintainable, and reversible.
* Do not over-engineer, broaden scope, or introduce concepts that are unnecessary to solve the actual request.
* Make the smallest change that preserves project integrity.
* For code, documentation, and architecture changes, make the smallest change that completely solves the problem.
* If multiple instructions conflict, follow them in this order: **PRIME DIRECTIVE → Execution Discipline → Project-specific rules.**

### Decision-Making Discipline

* Default to evidence from the current repository, implementation, tests, and active documentation over inference, convention, or general best practice.
* Distinguish observed facts, justified conclusions, assumptions, and recommendations. Do not present one as another.
* Preserve current intent, architecture, public behavior, and established project conventions unless a change is necessary and justified by the task.
* Do not optimize one file, component, or workflow at the expense of repository-wide consistency, user clarity, security, recoverability, or long-term maintainability.
* Resolve contradictions using the defined source-of-truth order. When the conflict cannot be resolved safely, identify it explicitly instead of inventing a compromise.
* Treat the smallest viable change as the default, but do not default to a smaller change when it leaves the underlying problem incomplete or inconsistent.
* Require a clear, material, long-term benefit before introducing any abstraction, dependency, convention, or architectural layer.
* Maintain existing terminology, interfaces, patterns, and ownership boundaries unless a justified migration is required.
* Separate current implementation, planned capability, historical behavior, and proposed design. Never blur their status.
* Evaluate decisions at both the local and system level. A locally correct change is not acceptable if it weakens the wider architecture or project model.
* Default to reversible decisions when evidence is incomplete or the operational impact is uncertain.
* Stop investigating immediately once sufficient evidence supports a safe, well-justified conclusion. Do not continue expanding scope without a material reason.

## 3. Project Identity and Boundary

### Identity

[PROJECT_NAME] is [ONE_OR_TWO_SENTENCE_PROJECT_IDENTITY].

Its primary responsibility is:

- [PRIMARY_RESPONSIBILITY_1]
- [PRIMARY_RESPONSIBILITY_2]
- [PRIMARY_RESPONSIBILITY_3]

The project should optimize for [CORE_QUALITIES].

### Current Implementation Status

Current implemented capabilities:

- [IMPLEMENTED_CAPABILITY]

Planned but not currently implemented:

- [PLANNED_CAPABILITY]

Use [AUTHORITATIVE_COMMAND_OR_SOURCE] before claiming that a capability is available.

<!-- Remove this section if implementation status is derived reliably from code or generated documentation. -->

### In Scope

- [IN_SCOPE_CAPABILITY]
- [IN_SCOPE_CAPABILITY]
- [IN_SCOPE_CAPABILITY]

### Explicit Non-Goals

Do not turn this project into:

- [NON_GOAL]
- [NON_GOAL]
- [NON_GOAL]

Do not add adjacent capabilities merely because they are technically possible. Require clear project fit and operational value.

## 4. Technical and Architectural Direction

### Required Direction

- [PRIMARY_PLATFORM_OR_RUNTIME]
- [PRIMARY_ARCHITECTURAL_STYLE]
- [PRIMARY_CONFIGURATION_OR_DATA_MODEL]
- [PRIMARY_DEPLOYMENT_OR_EXECUTION_MODEL]

Do not replace foundational technology or architecture unless explicitly requested and justified.

### Core Principles

- [PRINCIPLE]
- [PRINCIPLE]
- [PRINCIPLE]
- [PRINCIPLE]

Default to explicit, maintainable, reversible designs over clever or tightly coupled ones.
Preserve established boundaries and avoid hidden global state, circular dependencies, and unnecessary abstractions.

### Critical Boundaries

[DESCRIBE_THE_FEW_BOUNDARIES_THE_AI_MUST_NOT_BLUR.]

## 5. Repository and Source-of-Truth Rules

### Canonical Entry Points

- `[ROOT_ENTRY_POINT]`: [PURPOSE]
- `[DOCS_INDEX]`: [PURPOSE]
- `[PRIMARY_VALIDATION_COMMAND]`: [PURPOSE]

### Canonical Repository Areas

- `[PATH]`: [RESPONSIBILITY]
- `[PATH]`: [RESPONSIBILITY]
- `[PATH]`: [RESPONSIBILITY]

Use the existing layout. Never create parallel structures or restore removed legacy layouts without a justified migration plan.

### Source-of-Truth Precedence

Use this order when determining current behavior:

1. Current implementation and stable public, user-facing, or operator-facing interface
2. Current canonical documentation
3. Planned documentation
4. Archived documentation

Planned documents describe intent, not implemented capability. Archived documents are historical context only.

## 6. Project-Specific Engineering Rules

### Implementation

- Maintain existing style and helper patterns first.
- Make behavior explicit and failure states observable.
- Default to idempotent and safely repeatable operations where applicable.
- Preserve compatibility unless a breaking change is explicitly justified.
- Do not introduce a new dependency without clear material benefit.
- Do not hard-code deployment-specific values in generic project logic.

### Domain-Specific Safety

[LIST_ONLY_THE_SAFETY_RULES_UNIQUE_TO_THIS_PROJECT,
SUCH_AS_DATA_LOSS, FINANCIAL IMPACT, PRIVACY, HARDWARE CONTROL,
MIGRATIONS, CONCURRENCY, OR EXTERNAL SIDE EFFECTS.]

### Configuration and Secrets

- Never store secrets in source control.
- Require validation of all mandatory configuration before execution.
- Preserve user-managed values unless replacement is explicit.
- Default to conservative, portable defaults.
- Never expose secrets through logs, diagnostics, tests, or errors.

### Logging and Diagnostics

Logs and diagnostics should answer:

- What happened?
- Which component failed?
- What input or state caused it?
- What should be inspected next?

Avoid noisy output, duplicated messages, sensitive data, and false success states.

### Critical Component Contracts

For each critical component, define the applicable operational or lifecycle contract:

- ownership and responsibility
- inputs, outputs, and state
- configuration and dependencies
- failure and retry behavior
- compatibility and migration expectations
- observability and diagnostics
- recovery or rollback path
- resource or performance expectations

## 7. Change Discipline

### General

- Preserve current intent, architecture, and public behavior unless change is justified.
- Make the smallest complete change.
- Do not mix unrelated refactors with feature work.
- Do not reformat or rename unrelated code.
- Do not move files without updating all references and structural tests.
- Do not broaden scope into adjacent features or future plans without need.
- Never silently convert planned capabilities into implemented ones.
- Update directly affected references, tests, and documentation.
- For state-changing operations, account for interruption, partial completion, retries, and recovery. Default to atomic, transactional, staged, or safely repeatable designs where appropriate.

### Refactoring

Before a large refactor:

- identify the public, user-facing, or operator-facing behavior that must remain stable
- identify affected interfaces, files, tests, and documentation
- describe migration or compatibility concerns
- produce a short plan

After a refactor, summarize:

- files changed
- responsibilities moved
- behavior preserved
- compatibility impact
- validation performed

### Debugging

When debugging:

- identify observed behavior
- identify expected behavior
- reproduce through the smallest safe path
- locate the smallest relevant code path
- identify the root cause
- apply the smallest safe fix
- add a regression test when practical
- mention side effects and remaining risks

Do not randomly rewrite surrounding code while fixing one defect.

### Version Control Summary

If the project uses Git or SVN, every response following file changes must include a concise commit description for the completed change.

- Detect version control from repository metadata, configuration, or established project workflow.
- Use a Conventional Commits-style type prefix such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, or `revert:`.
- Use the most specific applicable type and an optional scope when useful.
- Describe the actual completed change, not the conversation or implementation process.
- Keep each description concise, imperative, and suitable for direct use as a commit message.
- Begin with a single summary line that describes the overall completed change using the same Conventional Commits-style format.
- Follow the summary with bullet entries for each material change. Use one bullet when the work contains only one material change.
- Do not replace the summary with the bullet list or omit the per-change bullets.
- Enclose the entire `Commit description` section in a standalone fenced code block labeled `text` so it can be copied directly and distinguished from the rest of the response.

Required format:

Commit description:

```text
A short summary of the completed change.

Changes:
- type(scope): first material change
- type(scope): second material change (if applicable)
...
```

## 8. Testing and Validation

### Canonical Validation

Use the repository's canonical validation command:

```bash
[PRIMARY_VALIDATION_COMMAND]
```

Run the narrowest relevant tests first, then broader validation when practical.
Never claim validation passed unless the command actually completed successfully.

### Test Safety

Tests must:

- use isolated test data and temporary paths
- never mutate production systems or user data
- avoid real destructive operations
- clean up safely after failure
- include negative cases for security-sensitive behavior

### Acceptance

A task is complete only when:

- the requested change is implemented
- unrelated files are unchanged
- relevant validation was run or limitations are clearly stated
- directly affected documentation is consistent
- operational or compatibility risks are disclosed
- no untested behavior is presented as verified
- Match validation depth to the change's risk: use regression tests for defects, negative tests for unsafe inputs, migration tests for state changes, compatibility tests for public interfaces, and recovery tests for destructive or persistent operations.

## 9. Documentation Rules

Documentation is part of the operational interface.

Update documentation when a change affects:

- public interfaces or commands
- repository paths or ownership boundaries
- supported capabilities
- configuration or data formats
- architecture or dependencies
- security or privacy assumptions
- deployment, migration, recovery, or validation workflows

Update only directly affected documents.
Do not duplicate implementation details across multiple documents when one canonical source and references are sufficient.

If implementation and documentation conflict:

1. Mention the conflict.
2. Determine which source represents intended current behavior.
3. Update the incorrect source when within scope.
4. Never silently preserve contradictory instructions.

## 10. Standard Response Formats

After making changes:

```text
Summary:
- ...

Files changed:
- ...

Validation:
- ...

Impact:
- ...

Notes:
- ...
```

For analysis-only tasks:

```text
Findings:
- ...

Recommendation:
- ...

Risk:
- ...
```

For architecture review:

```text
Architecture assessment:
- ...

Strengths:
- ...

Risks:
- ...

Recommended changes:
- ...

Score:
- ...
```

## 11. Priority Order

When priorities conflict, define and follow the project's actual risk order:

1. [PRIORITY_1]
2. [PRIORITY_2]
3. [PRIORITY_3]
4. [PRIORITY_4]
5. [PRIORITY_5]
6. ...

<!--
Example:
1. Correctness
2. Reliability
3. Security
4. Maintainability
5. Portability
6. User or operator clarity
7. Performance
8. Developer convenience
-->

Adjust this list only when the project's actual risk model requires a different order.
