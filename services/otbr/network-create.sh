# Create a brand-new Thread network on OTBR (operator entry point:
# lisa-edge otbr network create). This is a NETWORK REPLACEMENT operation:
# when an active dataset exists it is backed up and then replaced, and every
# device paired to the old network must be re-commissioned. There is no
# cosmetic rename of an established Thread network.
#
# Deploy-time automation (dataset/init-or-restore.sh) pre-authorizes the
# replacement with OTBR_NETWORK_CREATE_ASSUME_YES=1 after the provisioning
# wizard staged it; that variable is internal, not an operator interface.

Usage: lisa-edge otbr network create

Create a completely new Thread network named THREAD_NETWORK_NAME (.env).
When a Thread network is already active it is backed up first, then
REPLACED: existing Thread devices are disconnected and every test device
must be re-commissioned. A typed confirmation is required in that case.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this help.
