# Services

This directory owns every deployable service as a vertical slice. A service
keeps its Compose fragment, provisioning questions, source configuration and
service-specific recovery helpers together.

`registry.sh` is the canonical list of implemented selection keys,
dependencies and human-readable names. Run the public command instead of
reading internal files:

```bash
./lisa-edge service list
```

Only implemented services belong here. Planned services are documented under
`docs/planned/` until runnable code exists.
